        <p>
            Home Skateshop was started by a skateboarder in 1994.
            We are here to serve the community of Louisville and beyond with the highest quality skateboarding gear and
            accessories.
            We are still skater owned and operated to this day.

    <section class="history2">
        <p>Home is the longest running skateboards-only shop in the city.
            Our legacy began in 1988 with founding skater Becky Hornung: “I just wanted to share with the local skaters
            and
            give them a nice place to come and hang out and buy the stuff.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Back then, the shop was called Skateboards Unlimited and was Louisville’s first skateboards-only skate shop.
            When skateboarding slumped in 1993, Skateboards Unlimited went under.
            Sean Fawbush was the manager of Skateboards Unlimited when it closed down.
            He then started Home (a shop of his own), and Becky funneled her customers over to Fawbush-Louisville’s
            scene stayed alive.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have occupied four different locations over the years spanning from one side of the Highlands to the
            other.
