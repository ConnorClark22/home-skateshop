This is my final project for Code Louisville Course 1. I have chosen to build a website to give local consumers in Louisville, KY information about Home Skatshop using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It gives a description about the company and how it got started, some information on the different brands they carry, and a description of the team of local skateboarders they support along with a photo gallery of some of the team riders. In the footer you will find a link to a contact form, the return policy, and the privacy policy.

Here are the required features I chose for my project:

CSS:

-A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

-Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.

JavaScript:

-Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.

-Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.
